            <p>If you’re like me, you’ve spent the last decade waffling back and forth on Amazon. Maybe you’ve read a story about Amazon workers <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6055021/rushed-amazon-warehouse-staff-time-wasting/">peeing in bottles</a> on their shift in order to make better “rate,” or about how the company’s own records show that many of their warehouses have <a href ="https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/">significantly higher injury rates</a> than the industry average. You cancelled your Prime membership in a huff, feeling an individual sense of superiority. But then you needed a book for a class by Tuesday and after calling every local bookshop in the area without any luck, you realize that, as a student, you can sign up again for that Prime account at a pretty sweet discount and have the book by Sunday (ok, maybe that was just me). The company’s promise to get you anything for cheap by tomorrow was all too tempting.</p>

            <p>Amazon proudly touts “Customer Obsession” as the guiding principle by which all decisions are made at the company, and for the most part, they’ve won us over. Roughly 40% of online shopping is on their marketplace and about half of the cloud-based internet is hosted on their servers. Your mom shops at Amazon’s Whole Foods grocery stores and your teen cousin watches e-sports on Amazon’s Twitch streaming platform. In a <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/">December survey</a> by The Verge, more people said they had a favorable view of Amazon than any other big tech company. </p>

            <p>Now that many of us are staying at home to avoid catching or spreading coronavirus, Amazon’s business of conjuring packages at our doorstep feels even more vital. While businesses across the country shutter, and millions of people file for unemployment, Amazon’s stock price soars, and the company posted 175,000 new jobs starting at $17 an hour.</p>

            <p>But while the pandemic serves as a business opportunity for Amazon, it’s also turned up the heat for the simmering resistance against the company. Last Fall, I realized that my sporadic personal boycotts were never going to make much of a difference, so I started talking to organizers, activists, and workers to better understand the real fight against Amazon. At the time, the movement was broad and nebulous. Warehouse worker advocates had joined forces with environmental activists concerned about the company’s greenhouse gas emissions, digital privacy organizations opposed to its prodigious collection of data, and anti-trust lawyers critical of its size. A week before last year’s Cyber Monday holiday sales, this coalition announced their intention to fight Amazon together under the banner “Athena for All,” invoking the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare.</p>

            <p>Now, coronavirus has transformed the battle against Amazon, superseding many of the Athena coalition’s individual causes.  Workers who trusted the company for years saw Amazon insist that their warehouses remain open, even when they have dozens of coronavirus cases. Amazon told its workers that if they were afraid of getting sick at work, or infecting a fragile family member, they could stay home as long as they like, they just wouldn’t get paid unless they tested positive for COVID-19 or came in close contact with someone with the disease. Forced to choose between the safety of their loved ones or their ability to pay rent and afford food, many workers have expressed a growing sense of outrage that their boss, the wealthiest man in the world, is not doing more to protect them. </p>

            <p>Many of Amazon’s workers opted to stay home, leaving some warehouses nearly empty. Without its full workforce, Amazon’s “everything tomorrow” promise to customers evaporated. For all the fanfare the company has made over their robotic shelves and their prototype delivery drones, its supply chain still relies on living, breathing human beings, and the humans don’t feel safe.</p>

            <p>In the coronavirus age, Amazon is both mightier and more vulnerable than ever. For many of Amazon’s opponents, now looks like the time to strike.</p>

      <div class="container mt-5">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-7">
            <p>On a late January afternoon, back when people still shook hands with strangers, a group of environmental activists, warehouse workers, and labor organizers handed out protest signs in a bowling alley parking lot in Southern California’s Inland Empire region (about an hour or two east of LA, depending on traffic). The signs read, “AMAZON: WE DESERVE GOOD JOBS AND CLEAN AIR.” It was just one day after the first reports of a COVID-19 case in the United States, but no one was talking about coronavirus. The only omens of the spreading disease were the masks that many of the demonstrators wore to protest the pollution emitted by Amazon’s delivery trucks.</p>

            <p>I had driven down to the warehouse-filled region to see the cutting edge of the fight against Amazon in person. Amazon is the largest employer in the Inland Empire, and the company continues to open new facilities there regularly. Local politicians happily approve the new developments in the hopes they’ll bring more jobs and bolster the economy, but the jobs are grueling, and they don’t pay well, and along with the jobs come noisy, polluting trucks. This protest was the latest in a series of demonstrations by a coalition of labor, environmental, and community groups in the area to demand some worker protections and emissions restrictions at an enormous new facility planned at the former Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino. Amazon has not yet been officially announced as the tenant for this facility, but the developer Hillwood Development Agencies is building a similar building for Amazon in Fort Worth, Texas, and every local media report about the San Bernardino facility mentions that Amazon is rumored to operate it once it opens. Despite employing tens of thousands of people in the Inland Empire, Amazon has no corporate offices in the area, so the protest was instead going to be at Hillwood’s offices, a short walk from the bowling alley parking lot. </p>

            <p>At the beginning of 2020, pre-COVID, this is what the most visible fight against Amazon in the company’s largest US logistics hub looked like: a protest over a facility that hadn’t been built yet, at the office for the developer building it, who has still not publicly admitted to building that facility for Amazon. Rather than actively trying to unionize Amazon’s existing facilities, considered difficult if not hopeless, the organizers were working strategically to regulate future facilities. </p>

            <p>But I hadn’t only come to see Inland Empire residents protesting a new development. That week, not far away from this protest, Athena for All had held their first in-person meeting, or “Athena Convening,” since publicly announcing their coalition. The local activist groups, which included some of Athena’s founding member organizations, were hosting the Athena members in the Inland Empire, so they could share some of the strategies they had developed while working with each other. Before joining forces, many of Athena’s member organizations had won their own victories: the Minnesota-based Awood Center helped Somali American warehouse workers negotiate with Amazon for some accommodations to observe Ramadan and daily prayer; community organizers in Queens chased away Amazon’s planned headquarters there, which they feared would accelerate gentrification in their neighborhoods. Since launching their coalition with the help of $15 million from George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, Athena for All had held plenty of Zoom calls to coordinate remotely. But this protest in the Inland Empire, which local activists planned to coincide with the Athena Convening, was going to be the first time that Athena’s members took action together in the same physical space.</p>

            <p>I hoped I could talk my way into Athena’s meetings before the protest, and witness them talking shop firsthand, but everyone I asked told me that the meetings were open to Athena member organizations only. One of Athena’s founders and the local protest’s organizers, Sheheryar Kaoosji, agreed to meet me a couple days before the protests at the crowded community organizing center where he worked (oh co-working spaces, the before-times...) for an interview, and to explain some of the wariness I was encountering.<p>

            <p>Kaoosji is a longtime labor researcher and the CEO and founder of Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a non-profit that supports Southern California’s legions of shipping and logistics employees.  He is a gangly man with curly salt-and-pepper hair, whose phone seems to ring constantly. For both the national coalition and the local organizing campaign, Kaoosji explained why my desire to report on the inner workings of the fight against Amazon wouldn’t necessarily help the fight against Amazon. For example, there were secret plans that Athena members wouldn’t want public, since an ill-timed leak or revelation could give Amazon an advantage.</p>

            <p>A focus on the professional organizers might also distract from the grassroots efforts of the workers and community residents who were taking time out of their day to stand up to the largest employer in their region. “I’m not just pretending that this is all organic. Institutions matter, that why we’ve created institutions,” Kaoosji explains, but he resists what he calls “this older, ‘great men’ theory of organizing.” First of all, he says, it’s never reflected the reality of organizing movements. Even the most iconic progressive like Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and César Chávez were able to achieve change through the efforts of a vast network of people rallying together. Second, the “great men” theory of organizing is actually disempowering for people who see themselves as ordinary, and unable to take action on their own.</p>

            <p>“We don’t have charismatic leaders who are standing up and saying, ‘this is what we all have to do,’” Kaoosji explains. Instead Kaoosji believes organizers should start not with answers, but with questions: “‘Hey, what do you want to do? What’s the strategy that makes sense for your community?’ And then we’ll support you as best as we can to make that happen.”</p>

            <p>While clearly respected by everyone who works with him, Kaoosji is not himself a traditionally charismatic “great man” of history. He’s more comfortable navigating the intersecting bureaucracies of labor organizations and pouring over OSHA logs than making a speech in front of a crowd of people. On the protest day, before the gathered parking lot group heads over to Hillwood’s offices, another one of the organizers starts a “mic check” call-and-response. Typical mic checks are short, punchy, and inspirational to rev up a crowd:</p>

            <p>“Mic check”</p>
            <p class="tab">“Mic check!”</p>
            <p>“I believe that we will win!”</p>
            <p class="tab">“I believe that we will win!”</p>
             
            <p>But when it’s Kaoosji’s turn, he describes the logistics of the Athena members’ arrival in painstaking detail:</p>

            <p>“Mic check!”</p>
            <p class="tab">“Mic check!”</p>
            <p>“So, the two buses…”</p>
            <p class="tab">“So, the two buses…”</p>
            <p>“from the Athena convening…”</p>
            <p class="tab">“from the Athena convening…”</p>
            <p>“are about 5 minutes away.”</p>
            <p class="tab">“are about 5 minutes away.”</p>
            <p>“We want you guys to be at the front of the delegation.”</p>
            <p class="tab">“We want you guys to be at the front of the delegation.”</p>
            <p>“When the buses get here, they’ll unload and line up right behind you guys.”</p>
            <p class="tab">“When the buses get here, they’ll unload, and line up…” the crowd echoes and starts chuckling at all the logistics.</p>

            <p>When the Athena bus arrives, the organizers, who have come from all over the country, roughly double the number of people assembled. I could see why they didn’t want to dominate the press coverage, and potentially give the developer fuel to dismiss the protest as inauthentic or the work of outsiders. With the Inland Empire residents taking the lead, the crowd marched toward Hillwood’s office building.</p>

            <p>On the way over, the Athena organizers were all friendly, but rather than speak about their own organizations, they encouraged me to talk to the local community members about their demands for Hillwood. </p>

            <p>Amazon looms large in the community, and most of the locals I talked to had some personal connection to the development or Amazon, but for the most part they weren’t protesting as Amazon workers. Andres Garcia, a San Bernardino native who worked a stint at an Amazon warehouse a few years back, wore a mask from his current job at a concrete plant, where he would soon help pour the concrete used for the very facility they were protesting. He feels that the pollution in the region contributed to the asthma that both he and his father suffered from. Another protestor was there as a climate change activist, but asked that I refrain from naming them, because they work at an Amazon facility in the region. </p>

            <p>The only Inland Empire resident at the protest who would openly talk about working at Amazon was a bearded student named Nate, who asked I not use his last name so he could also keep his job. Nate was unnerved by all the shortcuts his coworkers were encouraged to take with their own safety. He was inspired to join this group of activists when he saw news about them protesting at a San Bernardino warehouse on Cyber Monday last year. At first, he was a little disappointed to discover that the group was not trying to unionize warehouses in the region. Historically unions, the time-honored foils of megacorporations like Amazon, have seen using their traditional methods to organize hundreds of thousands of employees at almost 200 Amazon facilities in the United States as nearly impossible.  The local chapter of the Teamsters was involved in the Inland Empire organizing effort, but were acting as a partner supporting the community organizations, rather than a union organizing a workforce. On the national level, union leaders regularly strategize with the Athena coalition, but no unions are official Athena member organizations. A legal note at the bottom of Athena’s webpage clarifies that they do not intend to represent employees in bargaining with Amazon over the terms of their employment. Seeing the airport facility campaign as the closest he could get to a union-organizing campaign, Nate joined anyway and started revising the lyrics of the classic organizing anthem “Solidarity Forever” to instead be about securing a community benefits agreement for the new facility.</p>

            <p> At the protest, Nate pounded on a drum as the group entered the lobby of Hillwood’s office building. The protestors, both Inland Empire residents and Athena’s visitors, crammed into the waiting room area of Hillwood’s offices, shouting for the developers to come out and discuss their list of demands. Hillwood called the police, but when two cops arrived, they told the Hillwood staff onsite that technically the lobby of their building was public property. A flustered Hillwood employee met in a side room with Kaoosji to discuss their list of demands, while the group of Inland Empire activists took turns making speeches in the waiting room. </p>

            <p>In the terminology of grassroots organizing, the protest was a textbook “direct action”: gather lots of people who believe in a cause into a specific place to make enough noise until their demands are heard. This is just one of many tactics from the grassroots playbook that are no longer viable in the coronavirus age, now that most offices are closed, and public health measures require six feet of distance between protestors. But no matter the playbook, this crowd of people were ready to fight, and in the next few months their fight would become more direct and urgent than ever before.</p>

            <p>On March 3rd, Amazon confirmed that its first employee to test positive for COVID-19 in the United States was not one of its warehouse workers, but a corporate employee at one of their headquarter buildings in Seattle, WA. Within two days, the company encouraged all of its Seattle-area corporate employees to work from home. But when states began issuing stay-at-home orders, and local businesses everywhere started shutting their doors, Amazon committed to keeping their delivery operation up and running, framing their work as essential. “Getting a priority item to your doorstep is vital as communities practice social-distancing, particularly for the elderly and others with underlying health issues,” wrote Dave Clark, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, in a post on the company blog. The company quickly announced they would hire 100,000 new workers (since increased to 175,000) to meet the demand of those ordering goods from their home. They gave their employees a raise of $2 an hour for working in dangerous times and allowed workers to file for unlimited unpaid time off.</p> 

            <p>Some workers (Nate included) quickly decided the extra $2 would not justify the risk of catching a potentially fatal disease and decided to stay at home. But many still needed to pay their bills, so they kept going to work, nervous about co-workers getting closer than six feet, wishing that the company could get them masks and gloves sooner. Then some of Amazon’s warehouse workers started testing positive for COVID-19.</p>

            <p>By the end of March, more than a dozen workers had tested positive at JFK8, Amazon’s warehouse in Staten Island, NY. (Amazon names each of its facilities with minimal creativity, slapping a number to the end of the three-letter code from a nearby airport.) On March 30th, workers staged a widely publicized walkout, demanding Amazon close JFK8, pay them better, and do more to keep them safe from coronavirus. The walkout made even more headlines after Amazon fired the walkout’s lead organizer, a 31-year-old assistant manager who had worked for Amazon for five years named Chris Smalls. Amazon said they fired Smalls for coming to the warehouse after he had been exposed to an infected coworker, but other workers with more direct exposure to coronavirus weren’t quarantined or fired. Smalls was certain the company fired him in retaliation for organizing the protest. In meeting notes leaked to Vice two days later, Amazon’s General Counsel David Zapolsky said they should try to make Smalls “the face of the entire union/organizing movement,” since he was “not smart or articulate.” (Smalls is black, and critics quickly pointed out that Zapolsky’s characterization carried racist and classist connotations.)</p>

            <p>Firing and smearing Smalls brought Amazon a lot of bad press, but also successfully scared plenty of workers who were considering speaking out. At the time, I was making a radio story about how workers were responding to coronavirus cases at one warehouse in Southern California, and once word spread about Smalls getting fired any workers who were previously comfortable sharing their name asked to be anonymous. </p>

            <p>I wanted to see how coronavirus had changed the priorities of organizers, so in early April I called up Kaoosji (who was no longer working from his co-working space) to hear what his team was doing to respond to the virus. First, the airport facility development fight was on the backburner. “In the short term, how do we support people to just survive?” Kaoosji said. “If we’re not in support of these folks, then who is? The company’s not. The state’s not doing anything.” </p>

            <p>Since social distancing recommendations preclude the tactics of traditional grassroots organizing, tactics like knocking on strangers’ doors, gathering workers into rooms, and staging mass protests, Athena member organizations like Warehouse Worker Resource Center have learned to organize from home and think creatively about how they use the internet. When the first Amazon worker in the Inland Empire tested positive for coronavirus, the organization streamed a video conference on their Facebook page featuring organizers, a local doctor, and the organization’s lawyer, who explained Amazon’s legal obligation to maintain a safe workplace and workers’ legal right to speak up about conditions they believe were unsafe. The video conference featured some Zoom call awkwardness and only a handful of live viewers during the initial stream but has since been viewed more than 30 thousand times.</p>

            <p>Warehouse Worker Resource Center also works with local Amazon workers and other organizers to moderate another Facebook page, “IE Amazonians Unite.” The “IE” stands for Inland Empire and “Amazonians” is the company’s nickname for its employees. refer page lists no official moderator publicly, but the local Athena organizers and some Amazon workers manage it together.</p>

            <p>As warehouse after warehouse in the region began seeing coronavirus cases, the IE Amazonians Unite page posted about warehouses with COVID-19 cases, often before Amazon told its own employees about those cases directly. Because the warehouse managers didn’t quickly share the news about COVID-19 cases with all their employees, workers heard about their sick coworkers through rumors on social media, then in their search for confirmation found IE Amazonians Unite. On the Facebook page, alongside the latest updates about coronavirus cases at Inland Empire warehouses, organizers circulated petitions for workers at each warehouse to demand that Amazon close those warehouses for deep cleaning, boost hazard pay, and do more to make their warehouses safer. </p>

            <p>In addition to showing worker support for changes, the petitions allowed organizers to gather workers’ contact information to follow up with next steps. After LGB3, the largest warehouse in the area announced it had four positive coronavirus cases, its petition quickly gained more than 500 signatures from workers at that warehouse. Next, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center used the emails and numbers gathered in the petition to find workers willing to file a joint complaint to CAL OSHA and local public health authorities. OSHA then followed up on the complaint and is currently in the process of inspecting the warehouse.</p>

            <p>Between the Facebook groups, the petitions, and the complaints, Warehouse Worker Resource Center and their colleagues are developing the infrastructure for workers to channel their confusion and fear into tangible action. By working discreetly, and primarily using the branding of “Amazonians Unite,” they are able to cultivate the impression, and ultimately the reality, that this is not just one worker center filing one OSHA complaint, but rather a growing movement of Amazon workers, learning to fight together. Amazon for its part has responded to few of the petition demands, but they have budged: by mid-April the company started doing temperature checks at warehouses, sending feverish workers home; they’re developing their own labs to test workers themselves; and they now have gloves and masks at their warehouses available for workers. </p>

            <p>“It’s not nearly enough, not nearly,” said Kaoosji, “but every time that workers take action, the company moves, and that’s the virtuous circle that we want people on. They go, ‘Ok, they did that. What’s next?’”</p>

            <p>While Athena members committed to traditional in-person grassroots organizing have had to adapt to meet this moment, other member organizations already had an online-first organizing strategy. United For Respect (UFR) is a retail worker advocacy organization and Athena member that was initially formed as a spinoff of an effort to unionize Wal-Mart. UFR hires former Amazon employees to trawl through worker Facebook groups, helping workers talk to each other and finding people who might make for strong worker voices in the media. UFR organizers themselves have remained silent on their tactics to the media and declined any on-the-record interviews between me and any of its staff members, saying they prefer that workers carry the story instead.</p> 

            <p>On Wednesday March 25th, Athena and UFR arranged a coronavirus-focused online press conference of Amazon workers. On the call, Jana Jumpp, a warehouse worker in Indiana said, “In 1981, I signed a contract with the Navy that I would give my life. I don't remember signing that with Amazon.” Two days later, NPR aired an interview where they played that clip for Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Public Relations and Policy Jay Carney. He sputtered in his attempt to answer her, eventually reminding the audience that Amazon was hiring more people to take the place of workers like Jumpp who were afraid for their lives.</p>

            <p>Jumpp, who in her 50’s describes herself as a motherly figure to many of her millennial warehouse colleagues, continued speaking up about what she saw as Amazon’s inadequate response to coronavirus on the vast network of Facebook groups for the company’s workers. At first, she got a lot of flak from other Amazon employees, including one group moderator who muted her, saying that she was scaring people. But as more Amazon facilities reported COVID-19 positive workers, the tone across Amazonian Facebook started to shift. </p>

            <p>Most Amazon worker Facebook groups ask people who want to join to state which warehouse they work at before admitting them, but the nearly 10,000-member group “Amazon Fulfillment Center UN-CENSORED workers 💦 memes” (the group name includes the emoji) allowed me in. The group features the chaos and range of the unmoderated internet, making for a significant contrast from the Athena-affiliated, deliberate, action-oriented “IE Amazonians Unite” page. Many workers use the group to make light of the situation. One post reads, “I don’t care if we are all wearing masks, you should still be putting on deodorant.” Another, “CAN US ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES GET AN ESSENTIAL BAR TO HAVE ESSENTIAL DRINKS AFTER WORK, BEFORE I ESSENTIALLY SLAP SOMEONE.”</p>

            <p>After Amazon tried lifting worker spirits by releasing a video of Jeff Bezos arriving at a warehouse, wearing a mask, (the company was providing masks to workers by then) the group’s commenters asked why Bezos wasn’t wearing a safety vest. Another poster edited the closing image of the video, Bezos overlooking the warehouse’s conveyor belts, machinery, and workers with the caption “AMAZON DISTRIBUTING COVID-19 SINCE 2020” (Within days, the warehouse Bezos visited confirmed its first COVID-19 case.)</p> 

            <p>The tone of the Facebook group is mostly crass and silly, but between the memes, the group’s members are discussing what the company owes them, and which actions are appropriate to take. Some complain about their managers not wearing their masks properly or neglecting to keep their distance. Others praise Amazon and emphasize the importance of fulfilling orders in these dangerous times. In typical internet commenter fashion, they call each other ungrateful nags and bootlicking pets, respectively. </p>

            <p>Amidst all the noise, Jumpp focused on posts about the coronavirus cases themselves. A moderator from one of the meme groups “You know you work at Amazon when” was keeping a list of warehouses with COVID-19 cases, but eventually got overwhelmed and asked Jumpp if she could take over. Amazon would confirm the first case at each warehouse to the press but regularly declined to confirm the growing subsequent cases. Once Jumpp started seeing Facebook posts about repeat cases, she started maintaining a count of the total number of cases for each warehouse.</p>

            <p>I was curious how Jumpp was counting, so I messaged her over Facebook, and she explained her process to me. Amazon would text workers about cases at their warehouses, workers screenshot those texts and sent them to Jumpp. Then, Jumpp would publish her count, which would catch the attention of more workers who would share more texts with Jumpp.</p>

            <p>I thought Jumpp might be working with Athena or United For Respect, and she does continue to volunteer for UFR, but it turned out that the tally was an independent project. “I just thought someone had to keep score,” she told me.</p>

            <p>When I first started talking to her, Jumpp was keeping her tally, which already included more than 300 cases at more than 100 facilities, in a notebook with paper and pen. (A few days prior, The New York Times had reported only 50 Amazon warehouses with coronavirus.) At some warehouses, Jumpp has now counted dozens more cases than have been publicly reported. With one early exception when the Governor of Kentucky personally asked Amazon to close a warehouse after it had three coronavirus cases, Amazon has refused to close any warehouses, even ones that only ship clothes or manage returns.</p>

            <p>I wanted to see if I could independently verify Jumpp’s numbers, so I created a shared Google Sheet for her and her colleagues to work out of, while I started a separate sheet where I could independently review and count the text messages Jumpp was logging. That task has proven challenging, since Amazon’s communications about new coronavirus cases to their employees are vague and inconsistent, and Jumpp continues to be swamped with new reported cases every day. Jumpp has now amassed a mountain of evidence and I have a plan to verify it, but I’m looking for a trusted media outlet to apply an editorial standard to the evidence and set a bar for confirmation. Otherwise, I’ll just be one more person who Amazon can dismiss with boilerplate PR copy.</p>

            <p>(Note: If you’re an editor interested in this data project, please contact me. I’m easy to find.)</p>

          <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
            <p>On April 24th, I woke up to a text message from Chris Smalls, the Staten Island strike organizer who Amazon fired. He had heard about the data project from Jumpp, and he wanted to talk. Smalls had spent the last month showing Amazon executives just how smart and articulate he could be, doing interview after interview lambasting the company. At first, one of Athena’s staff members helped Smalls book interviews, but the two had a falling out, and he was now working independently from Athena. Smalls had met similar organizers from Whole Foods, Instacart, and Target, and with them, he was spearheading an attempt to organize an international strike the following week on May Day. Smalls wanted to use the data Jumpp had gathered as part of his press release promoting the strike. I declined to be named in the press release, since I was still looking for a media outlet to help verify the data, but I asked if I could follow Smalls’ next steps, and he obliged.</p> 

            <p>In the leadup to the protest, Jumpp gave her updated tally of Amazonian coronavirus cases to reporters—now more than 600 nationwide. When the reporters asked for Amazon’s response, an Amazon spokesperson did not confirm or deny the figure, instead issuing a statement vaguely claiming they “object to the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon during this unprecedented health and economic crisis.” From following her activity on Facebook and in the Google Sheet, I know that Jumpp was working tirelessly to assemble these numbers. I had expected that Amazon would try to dismiss her claims, but the tone surprised me. In Amazon’s framing, their own workers desperately trying to glean information from the company’s own opaque communication were the ones irresponsibly navigating the crisis and at fault for any “misinformation.”</p>

            <p>Chris Smalls invited me to listen in on his twice weekly Zoom calls planning the May Day strike. In contrast to my difficulty seeing any of Athena’s strategizing firsthand, Smalls’ was an open book. He proudly told the workers and organizers from Amazon and other retailers on the call that producers from 60 Minutes and HBO were watching what they were doing with keen interest. Where many of the Athena organizers I spoke to preferred to speak on background, Smalls was happy to step into a public leadership role. “I’ve got to use this platform the right way. I’ve got to make sure that the voices that aren’t heard get heard,” Smalls told me. </p>

            <p>Smalls has a way of making these Zoom calls feel like history, like the start of a revolution, emerging out of the messy digital echo of a webinar. On the first Zoom call I observed, civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson was scheduled to join, but Jackson still uses a flip phone, and no one could figure out how to invite him to the call. Eventually one of Jackson’s surrogates on the call called him from his smartphone and held it up to his webcam. </p>

            <p>“Let me thank God for Chris and his courage. He is a North Star in darkness. He is the light of hope,” Jackson said. What Jackson said next, something about corporations and the wealthy, was inaudible, because a banging sound from an unmuted guest drowned him out. </p>

            <p>Finally, the iPad sound quieted down and Jackson could be heard clearly again. “I’m with you in spirit, I’m with you all the way…” Jackson said before he was cut off again. Smalls was using a free Zoom account and the time allotted had run out.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">A protest at an Amazon warehouse, with social distancing</figcaption>
        </figure>

            <p>On May Day at DSF6, a distribution center in Richmond, CA, journalists from a local tv station, national newspapers, and other media outlets outnumbered the protestors assembled. The protest was one of seven that Smalls and his allies had planned at Amazon warehouses across the country. Of the ten protestors there, most were Bay Area-based gig workers for Instacart, Uber, or Lyft who came to Richmond to protest at the Amazon facility so they could all have one place to gather. </p>

            <p>Adrienne Williams, a former schoolteacher and a delivery driver for Amazon, was the only protestor who actually worked at DSF6. Early in the protest, Williams was able to recruit one other Amazon worker to briefly join their picket line, by reminding him of exactly how many billions of dollars Jeff Bezos was worth, while he still struggled to pay for child support on the wage he received working at the warehouse. The other worker stood around for about 20 minutes on one of the spots Williams had chalk-marked every six feet on the sidewalk. After talking to some of the journalists there, he turned in his sign and wandered off. </p>

            <p>As other yellow-vested Amazon employees drifted in and out of the warehouse to take their lunch break, they eyed the protest, but kept their distance. A few workers told me they had no idea what was happening, since they were part of Amazon’s 175,000 new crisis hires, and it was one of their first days on the job. Looking for some people who had some more experience at the warehouse, I walked over to a cluster of five Amazon workers hanging out around one of their cars in the parking lot to ask what they thought of the protest. A young woman wearing her boyfriend’s baseball cap told me that she would join if she knew she could protest without worrying about getting fired. She takes care of her elderly grandpa at home, and she worries she’ll catch the virus at the warehouse and infect him, but she still needs the job to pay the bills. One of her friends told me that he wouldn’t protest whether or not he thought his job was at risk. He would rather just stand back and watch the protest. “Amazon’s not going to change,” he explained. </p>

            <p>Before I could write down their names, a tall freckled man who appeared to be an Amazon manager came over and told me I had to leave the parking lot. He refused to answer any of my questions.</p>

            <p>If Williams was discouraged by the turnout of her fellow Amazonians, she didn’t show it. When I asked Williams if she was hopeful at all, she told me that sometimes she felt hope was dangerous. “Hope to me is the sense that the problem is going to get fixed,” Williams explained, “And when you’re not hopeful there’s this sense that you have to get off your ass and fix it yourself.” </p>

            <p>There was one clear sign that other Amazon workers supported what Williams was fighting for. Throughout the day, as Amazon’s delivery drivers drove past the protestors, they honked their horns and held up their fists in solidarity, before they turned the corner to get customers their deliveries.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Adrienne Williams said she believes there is solidarity between Amazonians, but many are too scared to show it.</figcaption>
        </figure>

            <p>At the top of Amazon’s list of “Leadership Principles,” Amazon defines Customer Obsession, “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.” Amazon uses their customer obsession to justify everything else, including its treatment of workers. In ordinary times, they demand exacting productivity rates from their workers, because customers want their orders fulfilled by tomorrow. In the middle of the pandemic, Amazon can’t close their warehouses or pay workers to stay at home, because customers still want everything at the best price, as fast as humanly possible.</p>
 
            <p>In a letter to shareholders in 2008, Jeff Bezos wrote, “It is difficult for us to imagine that ten years from now, customers will want higher prices, less selection, or slower delivery.” Even during the pandemic that remains true. Customers want things, whether necessary or frivolous, and we want them right away and cheap. </p>

            <p>But as the coronavirus pandemic has stretched our global economy to a breaking point, it has also revealed the limits of this business plan, when taken to the extreme. Amazon now divides the world into workers and customers. Either because customers hold white-collar jobs that transition easily into working from home, or they have a comfortable balance in their savings account, Amazon’s customers stay at home, safely ordering the things they need and want. On the other side of that transaction, unseen by the customers, are hundreds of thousands of workers, who, in order to make rent and feed their families, now must risk their lives and the lives of the people closest to them.</p>

            <p>The coronavirus pandemic has made clear though, that this division of customer and worker is an illusion. (And not just because it’s possible for the virus to survive on Amazon’s smiling cardboard boxes for 24 hours, leaving plenty of time for the virus to hitch a ride from one of its facilities to customers’ homes.) The customer and the worker both sustain the ecosystem Amazon has cultivated. Even customers who choose to boycott the company will have a hard time avoiding an internet mostly hosted by Amazon. Businesses that try to pay their workers more or deliver their products more slowly and safely will still have to compete with Amazon’s prices and delivery promises. Wherever we go, an Amazon Echo device might record our conversation, or an Amazon Ring doorbell might capture our walk through the neighborhood. It’s time we recognize that in the future Amazon is building, we are all Amazonians, whether we like it or not. </p>
 
            <p>If Amazon is going to start listening to demands about how to keep its warehouse employees safe and healthy, or to reduce their carbon emissions, or to respect individual privacy, those demands can’t be coming from their boldest warehouse workers alone.</p>

            <p>The fight for a safer, more responsible Amazon needs all Amazonians fighting for each other: warehouse workers, delivery drivers, and customers; tactical nonprofit organizations and pissed-off former employees; celebrities starring in buzzy Prime Video original series and producers making new podcasts for Audible; your mom shopping for groceries at Whole Foods and your teen cousin streaming Fortnite on Twitch. </p>

            <p>Amazonians unite.</p>
